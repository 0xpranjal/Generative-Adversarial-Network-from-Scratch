# Generative Adversarial Network
This repository is to demonstrate how we can create new images of a distribution of images with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).


## What is GAN ?
> GAN is a architecture which makes use of multiple neural networks that compete against each other to make the predictions.

> ##### Generator: The network responsible for generating new data from training a data.

> ##### Discriminator: Identifies and distinguishes a generated image/fake image from an original image of the training combined together form a GAN, both these networks learn based on their previous predictions, competing with each other for the better outcome.
